          Original from Tel Aviv, I have been living in Belin for the past 3 years with my husband. A year and a half
          ago our daughter Lyri joined us.
          My favorite things in life are my family, friends, coffee and reading. I usually read 3-4 books at the same
          time, I use books as escapism so my favorite genres are YA (Yong Adults) books and fantasy.<br>
          <br>
          For the past decade, I have been working in the field of Digital Marketing in different roles; as
          SEO,Specialist, Campaigns Manager Project Manager and Retention Manager. And now I'm excited to start my
          journey into becoming web developer.
